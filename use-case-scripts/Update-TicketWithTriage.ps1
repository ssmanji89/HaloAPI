<#
.SYNOPSIS
   Updates a ticket with actionable triage steps generated in JSON format.
.DESCRIPTION
   This script accepts a ticket identifier and a JSON formatted comment (generated by the Invoke-PSOpenAITriageTicket.ps1 script),
   then simulates updating the ticket with the provided actionable next steps.
   In a real-world implementation, this script could interact with your ticketing systemâ€™s API to update the ticket record.
.PARAMETER TicketId
   The unique identifier for the ticket to be updated.
.PARAMETER TriageCommentJson
   A JSON formatted string containing triage details such as priority, actionable steps, and additional comments.
.EXAMPLE
   .\Update-TicketWithTriage.ps1 -TicketId "TICKET-123" -TriageCommentJson '{"ticketId": "TICKET-123", "priority": "high", "actionableSteps": ["Restart the network interface", "Notify network team"], "comments": "Immediate action required due to network outage."}'
.NOTES
   This script is designed to work alongside the Invoke-PSOpenAITriageTicket.ps1 script.
